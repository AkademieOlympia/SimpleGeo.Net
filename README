The currently available SimpleGeo .Net client library originally referenced at simplegeo.com seemed somewhat.. orphan and outdated and even though I'd like to contribute, VisualBasic.Net is a personal show-stopper for me.

That's why I decided to start hacking away on C# / .Net 4 based client library.

This is currently still WORK IN PROGRESS, however, if you want to hop in and help.. contact me and/or fork away...

Enjoy!
